Tiled Matrix Multiplication

    In your kernel implementation, how many threads can be simultaneously executing
    on a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, which contains 20 Streaming Multiprocessors. Use
    nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" matrixmul_kernel.cu to see the resource usage of 
    your kernel (although compilation will fail, it will only do so after
    compiling the kernel and displaying the relevant information.)




Number of threads that can be executed simultaneously on the GTX1080 GPU :

By using   nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" matrixmul_kernel.cu command we get the following results : 

ptxas info    : Used 23 registers, 2048 bytes smem, 104 bytes cmem[0]

So each SM here uses 23 registers, 2048 bytes of shared memory and 104 bytes if the constant memory 

Since TILE_WIDTH here is 16, each thread block will have 16*16 = 256 threads.
